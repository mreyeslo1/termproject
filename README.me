	My approach to the walking problem was try to study a natural human walking motion and break down the movements and focus on points of balance.  I broke away from natural movement a little bit to make sure a foot was placed on the ground before shifting weight towards it.  I used a linear interpolation routine to move between my key frames.  My goal was to be able to get the robot to make a real step forward instead of just shuffling or waddling along, and I feel that I succeed by getting hubo to get two foot-lengths of displacement on only two steps.
